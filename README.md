# Proyecto_ML_in_oral_cancer

This is my Thesis project to graduate from my bachelors in Informatics Civil Engineer in Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, its about the use of Machine Learning Models to identify patients with signs of oral cancer (or pre-cancer), some signs of it are:
- Leukoplasia: White lesions.
- Eritroplasia: Red Lesions
- Eritroleucoplasia: yeah, you guested it, white and red lesions.

The oral cancer doesn't have a good prognosis for most patients, in general, it's because they get late diagnosed and the cancer has already spread or became Malignant.
¿But why they get diagnosed when the cancer is already in a late stage?
Well, the signs are not that clear in comparison to others cancers and they even don't show sintoms until it's late.
Also, this cancer is the 10th most common, soooo in the medical field of research, this isn't the top of priorities.

## Content
- Jupyter Notebook with (almost) all the development of the project, its a little bit messy, but has a lot of testing, models and some comments.
- The PDF's I used to backup my research and development, some of them have a medical approach and other some more of a Machine Learning, The combination of both is necessary to make the most complete work and get the quality necesary to help patients.
- Photos of patients (without faces for privacy law), diagrams of process and models structure, AUC-ROC curves and charts of data distribution.
